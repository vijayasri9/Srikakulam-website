                    Srikakulam, nestled between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal, is a vibrant mosaic of tribal wisdom,
                    rhythmic dances, and soulful folk songs. The regionâ€™s indigenous communitiesâ€”like the Savara, Jatapu, Konda Dora,
                    and Chenchuâ€”have preserved their cultural identity through expressive art forms that echo through hills, forests,
                    and village squares.
