            <p>

              The Kothamma Thalli Jathara in Kotabommali, Srikakulam, is a vibrant and deeply revered festival 
              celebrated annually from October 1st to 3rd, now officially recognized as a state festival by the 
              Andhra Pradesh government.Devotees from Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Jharkhand flock 
              to the temple to offer prayers and fulfill vows to Kothamma Thalli, the guardian goddess of the region.
              The festivities include special rituals, cultural performances, and a grand procession, with the temple 
              beautifully illuminated and adorned for the occasion. The legend behind the temple speaks of a divine 
              encounter in the early 20th century, where the goddess revealed herself to a devotee, leading to the
              establishment of the Kothamma Thalli temple as a powerful spiritual center.Devotees offer silken garments,
              turmeric pots, and traditional gifts, believing the goddess grants wishes and protects her devotees like a
              Kalpavalli‚Äîa wish-fulfilling divine mother

            <h1>Dolotsavam ü•Å </h1>
            

            <p>
                Dolotsavam is a vibrant three-day celebration, typically held in the month of Phalguna (February‚ÄìMarch),
                 where the deity is placed on a richly decorated swing (dola) and gently rocked by devotees.The event is
                 accompanied by devotional music, Vedic chanting, and cultural performances, creating a spiritually charged
                 atmosphere. The utsava murti (processional idol) of Kurmanatha Swamy is adorned with flowers and ornaments 
                 and taken in a ceremonial procession before being placed on the swing. It symbolizes divine play (leela) and 
                 the loving relationship between the deity and devotees, much like Krishna‚Äôs Dolotsavam in other Vaishnavite traditions.
                 Held near the sacred Sweta Pushkarini (temple tank), the festival draws pilgrims from across the region, blending ritual,
                 music, and devotion in a serene coastal setting

               bulls are bathed, decorated, and worshipped for their role in farming. In Srikakulam, these
               festivals reflect deep agrarian roots, coastal customs, and vibrant community spirit. Villages 
               come alive with rituals, folk songs, and festive meals, blending tradition with heartfelt celebration.
