                 Naupada, in Srikakulam district, is known as the Salt Bowl of Andhra Pradesh.
                 Its shimmering salt pans stretch across coastal lands, producing raw salt called Kallu Uppu.
                 Over 5,000 families depend on this traditional craft, passed down through generations.
                 Once spread over 6,000 acres, salt farming now faces decline due to policy and market challenges.
                 Yet, each crystal harvested here carries the legacy of resilience, culture, and coastal pride.
                 The salt-making process is entirely solar-evaporative, making it eco-friendly and sustainable.
                 Women play a vital role‚Äîsorting, drying, and packing salt under the blazing sun.  
                 The salt pans also serve as wetland habitats, attracting migratory birds like flamingos, cranes, and herons.
                 During local festivals, salt is offered in temples as a symbol of purity and sustenance.
